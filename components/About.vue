                Hi, I'm Chris, a passionate software engineer who loves building
                user-friendly applications that solve real-world problems. Since
                my first contact with professional software engineering as a
                testing working student in 2020, I have been fascinated by the
                possibilities of creating applications to support people in
                their daily lives. Since then, I have pro-actively grown my
                skillset from testing, to frontend engineering roles, and being
                a full-stack developer. I have been collecting valuable
                experiences in designing, developing, and testing robust and
                efficient web applications, either during my M.Sc. Applied
                Computer Science degree, my working student jobs at different
                companies, or my projects. I love to work in small and agile
                teams, where I can have a direct impact on the product's
                adoption and the customer's satisfaction.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
                If I'm not currently being productive on my laptop, I like to
                play team sports üèÄ, do yoga üßò, or read books üìö.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am most proficient with modern technologies like
                <i
                    >VueJS, TypeScript, HTML/CSS, Kotlin, Java, Spring Boot,
                    Docker, Kubernetes, GCP,</i
                >
                etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, I do not limit myself to a specific stack or language.
                My open-mindedness and my ability to transfer my knowledge to
                new technologies and concepts have always determined my
                professional success.
